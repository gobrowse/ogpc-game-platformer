We decided on a platformer game for today. We made the Google Doc for OGPC, and I recorded the meeting with open audio, which recorded my screen. We made the game portfolio google doc, and Lucia is making the graphics.
Lucia is using Piskel for the art, and Kavish is using Bandlab
I also made a GitHub repo for this project
next time we will present the game mechanics. This meeting happened on Jan 26, 2025.
