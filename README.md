**Super Storm Bros.** is a platformer made for OGPC 2024-2025. We are Weather Warning, and we made Super Storm Bros.


We have many levels with ladders to climb between platforms and the main character can run or jump to reach the ladders. To finish a level you need to reach the yellow door. Each level has a mystery weather mob that is going to attack you. 


**How to play:**
Use arrow keys to navigate your way through to the portal and move from level to level by escape to help Jim and Maya escape the natural disasters.

**Game Engine**

We used Gandi IDE (https://www.cocrea.world/gandi) to make this code. We did not use scratch (scratch.mit.edu) becouse it was harder to use as a team, and gandi has built in collaboration feautres to make it faster for our team to work together.
